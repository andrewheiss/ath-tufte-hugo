# Tufte CSS + Hugo

This is the template for my course-specific websites.


## CSS provenance and credit

[Tufte's CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) is relatively basic and doesn't deal with headers and footers and other basic website elements. The [Tufte Jekyll theme](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) has all these, but it's written for Jekyll (*and* it's written in Sass).

So, I went to [the demo page](https://clayh53.github.io/tufte-jekyll/), copied [the compiled CSS file](https://clayh53.github.io/tufte-jekyll/css/tufte.css) there, and used that as my base CSS file. It probably still has a lot of Jekyll-specific things that I don't use, but ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

And *then* I pilfered from [John Martin's excellent modifications](https://johndmart.in/) and made my own.
